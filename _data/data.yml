      company: 3D Modeling and Processing Lab, Seoul National University
      details: |
        Supervised by professor **Myung-Soo Kim**, I have been a master student of [3D Modeling and Processing Lab](http://3map.snu.ac.kr/) in SNU.
        In this lab, I have worked on following geometric issues :
          - **Hausdorff Distance** : I am *currently* working on an algorithm to compute Hausdorff distance between freeform surfaces.
          - **Parameter Inversion** : I have developed an algorithm to solve parameter inversion problem for freeform surfaces and volumes.
          - **Rectangle Swept Sphere(RSS)** : I have developed an algorithm to bound freeform surfaces tightly with RSS and contributed to surface-surface intersection algorithm's acceleration([paper]()).
          - **Torus** : I have developed a novel algorithm to find minimum distance between toroidal patches and accelerated minimum distance computation between solids of revolution([paper]())([github]()).
          - **Spherical Shell** : I have developed an algorithm to bound surface of revolution with spherical shell and accelerated minimum distance computation between surfaces of revolution([paper(Korean)]()).
          - **Medial Axis Transform** : I have developed a GPU algorithm to compute medial axis, or bisector, of two bicubic Bezier surfaces in interactive time([video]()).
    - role: Game Engine Programmer (Intern)
      time: July 2018 - Sep 2018
