    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
      I am a second year **Master** graduate student supervised by professor **[Myung-Soo Kim](http://3map.snu.ac.kr/mskim)**. <br/>
      My research interests lie on <strong>Computer Graphics, Geometry Processing, Machine Learning, and AR/VR</strong>. <br/>
      Previously, I was an undergraduate student at SNU majoring in <strong>Archaeology</strong> and <strong>Computer Science and Engineering</strong>, and graduated <strong>Summa Cum Laude</strong>. Still, I am interested in analyzing historical artifacts with computers.<br/>
      Also, I am an avid video game player, so I spent my summer vacation in 2018 as a game engine programmer intern at <a href="https://www.smilegate.com/en/main/main.asp">Smilegate</a>.

        Supervised by professor **[Myung-Soo Kim](http://3map.snu.ac.kr/mskim)**, I am a master student in [3D Modeling and Processing Lab](http://3map.snu.ac.kr/) at SNU.
        In this lab, I have worked on following issues :
          - **Hausdorff Distance** : I am *currently* working on an algorithm to compute Hausdorff distance between freeform surfaces.
          - **Parameter Inversion** : I have developed an algorithm to solve parameter inversion problem for freeform surfaces and volumes.
          - **Rectangle Swept Sphere(RSS)** : I have developed an algorithm to bound freeform surfaces tightly with RSS and contributed to surface-surface intersection algorithm's acceleration. [[paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010448520300592)]
          - **3D Shape Retrieval** : I have developed an algorithm to conduct 3D shape retrieval using spherical bounding volume hierarchies as a term project for a course. [[paper](https://github.com/SonSang/Course-Project_Machine-Learning-and-Optimization-for-3D-Data/blob/master/Paper/Shape%20Retrieval%20with%20Spherical%20Bounding%20Volume%20Hierarchy.pdf)][[github](https://github.com/SonSang/Course-Project_Machine-Learning-and-Optimization-for-3D-Data)]
          - **Torus** : I have developed a novel algorithm to find minimum distance between toroidal patches and accelerated minimum distance computation between solids of revolution. [[paper](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/cgf.13950)][[github](https://github.com/SonSang/MinuteTorus)][[talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BoRHXYlMLIg&t=47m57s)]
          - **Spherical Shell** : I have developed an algorithm to bound surface of revolution with spherical shells and accelerated minimum distance computation between surfaces of revolution. [[paper](http://www.riss.kr/search/detail/DetailView.do?p_mat_type=1a0202e37d52c72d&control_no=557421bed7e75a9ec85d2949c297615a)][[ppt](https://github.com/SonSang/online-cv/blob/master/assets/papers/KCGS_Presentation.pptx)]
          - **Medial Axis Transform** : I have developed a GPU algorithm to compute medial axis, or bisector, of two bicubic Bezier surfaces in interactive time. [[paper](https://github.com/SonSang/online-cv/blob/master/assets/papers/Bachelor_Thesis_Bisector%20Surface%20Construction%20for%20Two%20Bicubic%20Bezier%20Surfaces.pdf)][[video](https://youtu.be/KcjTJ2wsBiw)]
    - degree: BA in Archaeology<br/>BSc in Computer Science and Engineering
      university: Seoul National University
      time: Mar 2012 - Feb 2019
      details: |
        I majored in **Archaeology** and **Computer Science and Engineering** at SNU, and graduated **Summa Cum Laude**.
        I authored following two bachelor thesis :
          - **Sang Hyun Son**, [Analysis of Hunter-Gatherer Subsistence Strategy with Computer Simulation](https://github.com/SonSang/online-cv/blob/master/assets/papers/Bachelor_Thesis_Analysis%20of%20Hunter-Gatherer%20Subsistence%20Strategy%20with%20Computer%20Simulation.pdf), 2018 (Korean)
